In this blog post I will be talking about Hyper-V, specifically for server usage.

So what is Hyper-V?

    Hyper-V is Microsoft's version of a virtual machine host. In Hyper-V you can have
    hardware virtualization which means you can create hard drives, virtual switches,
    and more. It comes with Windows Server 2019 Standard or Datacenter edition, with 
    Standard version allowing  you to host 2 VMs and Datacenter unlimited. Hyper-V 
    supports any OS to be virtualized, including Linux(Ubuntu,Redhat,CentOS, etc.),
    FreeBSD, and of course Windows.

<bold>Why should you use Hyper-V?</bold>

    As an IT Technician you may need to do testing on fresh installs of operating systems,
    and instead of having to buy a new computer to test, you can just host it on Hyper-V.
    You can modify the RAM, HDD space, # of processors, and more. Say a client asks you
    to set up a new network environment for them. They need a web server, a remote desktop
    server, a gateway server, a domain controller and multiple other servers and they like
    to keep them separate. Instead of having to buy many different physical servers, you
    could buy just one physical server with enough resourcess that will host Hyper-V 
    which will run every one of the other servers in a Virtual environment. This way,
    managing them is a lot easier and you can increase resources whenever is needed
    rather than setting a fixed amount. 


Next week I will be writing about how to Install Hyper-V.
