<h1>Kubernetes Basics Part 2</h1>

Let's continue where we left off. By entering "kubectl get pods" we can look for existing pods that are being used.

This shows us the pods running but t does not show us the details. To see the details, type "kubectl describe pods"

Lets run "kubectl proxy" to get a new window that runs a proxy so we can interact and debug the pods. In addition, 
we can run "export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -o go-template --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}')
echo Name of the Pod: $POD_NAME" to get the pod name and also store it in the pod_name environment variable.

If you ever want t see the logs that get stored for the containers, you can type the ocmmand "kubectl logs $POD_NAME"

Once the pod is up and running you can use the command "https://i.imgur.com/dVx4KGD.png" to see the list of the environment
variables

Next let's type "kubectl exec -ti $POD_NAME bash" This opens a console on the container that we run our NodeJS application.
The server.js file holds the source code of the app. By typing "cat server.js"

Type "exit" to close the container connection.

That is the basics of exploring your App. Next week we will continue with scaling and updating your App.
