Hello everyone, my name is Armen Chovardian and I am majoring in Computer Information Technology. I work at Alternate Networks Technology which is a small business company that provides network infrastructure to companies and also IT support when needed. 

I had some issues initially on creating a github blog with Jekyll.
I spent the first 2 hours trying to configure it and learn how to commit and push through the command line in Windows. I had to create 3 different repositories and delete them until I finally found a good video that helped me finally create this. 

I am planning on adding a better theme and hopefully creating my own eventually. I am excited to learn everything this class is going to offer and I look forward to graduating.
