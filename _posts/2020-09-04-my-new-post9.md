<h1> Automating User Creation in Active Directory </h1>

<p>Creating users in Active Directory is very easy using the user interface, but what if you had to create 50 users with different passwords. That would take a very long time to do using a graphical interface. I wanted to show you how to automate this process to make your life easier.</p>

1) Let’s start by opening our active directory and creating a new Organization Unit with whatever name you like the users to be in. I will name mine “Company Users”

2) Next you are going to need an excel file that looks like this:

3) Fill out the information like you would on Active Directory with the users name, last name, username and password. For the OU section, you will need to put your domain name and the folder name.

4) Next we are going to need a PowerShell script. Let’s open up PowerShell and paste the code below in the file.

<code>#Enter a path to your import CSV file
$ADUsers = Import-csv C:\users.csv

foreach ($User in $ADUsers)
{

       $Username    = $User.username
       $Password    = $User.password
       $Firstname   = $User.firstname
       $Lastname    = $User.lastname
       $OU           = $User.ou

          
        #Account will be created in the OU listed in the $OU variable in the CSV file; don’t forget to change the domain name in the"-UserPrincipalName" variable
              New-ADUser `
            -SamAccountName $Username `
            -UserPrincipalName "$Username@mydomain.com" `
            -Name "$Firstname $Lastname" `
            -GivenName $Firstname `
            -Surname $Lastname `
            -Enabled $True `
            -ChangePasswordAtLogon $False `
            -PasswordNeverExpires $True `
            -DisplayName "$Lastname, $Firstname" `
            -Path $OU `
            -AccountPassword (convertto-securestring $Password -AsPlainText -Force)

       }
       
	   
	  </code>

5) What this script does is use the Excel file to read the information and then creates new users based on what is put on the excel file. In order for this to work, we will need to put our users.csv file straight to the C: drive. Next thing you will need to change is the “-UserPrincipalName” to username@ whatever your domain is.

6) Once ready let’s click on the run button as shown below.

7) If no error messages pop up that means everything went well and the script ran successfully. As seen on the picture below the users were created.

That is all there is to it. You could also have ran PowerShell and executed all the codes one by one but that would require you to change lots of settings and arguments. You would also need to be proficient in PowerShell. This method is much easier for automating the creation of lots of users.
