So I'm halfway done with the LAMP stack. I had to do something similar at work before so I am a bit familiar with it. I first had to create a Virtual Machine of Linux on my computer so that I could run a Linux machine. I installed Ubuntu on it and then followed the instructions and everything seems to be working fine. At first I had to watch a couple of videos of Docker to fully understand what it is and what it does because I was confused at first and I didn't just want to blindly follow the directions. I will continue this project tomorrow and update this blog if I have problems with anything else.
