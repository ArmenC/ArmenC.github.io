<h1> MySQL Databases with Ansible </h1>

I have been working with ansible to populate databases with mysql dump files and I wanted to make a tutorial on how to create databases with Ansible first.


1) Let's start by creating a hosts file and putting the info as shown.

2) Next we will need to create a playbook. We will need a yaml file that that will contain the info for the mysql server. Fill the password area with your root password of the mysql server.

3) The next step is to write the steps of the playbook. Let's start by telling ansible that we want mysql installed. Enter what is shown below:

4) Although MySQL is installed, we need to make sure to launch it and also confirm that it is running on startup.

5) The next steps are to configure the password for all the root accounts on the installation. Use the code below to set up the "mysql_user" module and the privileges set with the "with_item" code.

6) Now that we have our SQL task, next would be to create and add the database with the data. We will do this using a SQL dump file. Let's write the steps below before we create our dump file.

7) Next we will need to create the dump file we mentioned earlier. Create the "dump.sql" file and enter the information below. This will add some data to a table. This will help us test and see if our ansible will populate the tables.

8) Your ansible work has finished. Now we will need to run the playbook and make sure it works! After ansible finishes run basic mysql commands as shown below and you will see your populated table!

You are finished! This is just one of the few things you can do with Ansible. I am learning more about Ansible and I am working with Google Cloud Platform to automate tasks to populate GCP instances.
I will make a tutorial on this next week.
