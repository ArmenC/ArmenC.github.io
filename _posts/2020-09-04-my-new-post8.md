<h1> Creating a SQL instance in Google Cloud Platform </h1>

Nowadays, everything is starting to move to the cloud. Google Cloud Platform offers an easy solution to have
your databases in the cloud. Let me show you a simple creation of a SQL instance and how to connect to it.

1) Lets start by selecting "Create Instance"

2) This is where you will enter your information for the instance. Start by putting the name, a secure password, and leave the database version to "MySQL 5.7". For the region, select the one closes to you. Finally select "Create Instance".

3) The SQL Server will take about 10 minutes to finish. Once finished, start by going to the Users TAB.

That's all there is to connecting to your sql server. Now you can start creating your tables and populating them all in the cloud!

<h1>OPTIONAL</h1>

If you like to connect to the server using mysql-server you can go to the navigation bar "Connections" and enter your ip address.

After that use the command "mysql --host="[INSTANCE IP]" --user=[your username] --password" and then enter the password.
