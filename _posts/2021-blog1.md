<h1>How to open ports on Mikrotik router</h1>

If the user has static IP configure the following:

- Check what their WAN subnet is and how many usable IPs they have.

- Make sure no existing rules will conflict with the new rules you create.

- The protocol will either be TCP or UDP. But this will depend on what service is being opened. It is TCP most of the time.

If the user has dynamic IP configure the following:

- Make sure no existing rules will conflict with the new rules you create.

- The protocol will either be TCP or UDP. But this will depend on what service is being opened. It is TCP most of the time.

- Set the In Interface to the WAN port. You can verify the WAN port by checking IP > DHCP Client.

In both scenarios the action tab will look like this:

- The To Addresses will be the internal IP of what we are trying to open.

- The To Ports is optional but can be set if you are doing something custom and it's needed.

- Remember that the order of NAT rules matters. Try to keep things organized and create comments as much as you can.

Next week I will continue writing about MikroTik routers.
