This week I didn't work on anything classroom related because there isn't anything assigned because of Labor day weekend. Instead I would like to talk about
what kind of work I did at my job and some challenging problems.

One of our customers wanted to upgrade their server environment. They wanted to migrate from ESXi to Hyper-V. Basically they have one physical server, that is running ESXi
with mulitple virtual machines. We had to do the migration over the weekend when they were closed, because it would cause disruptions. There isn't much troubleshooting
in this area, but after we finished, the next couple of days we kept receiving tickets of printers not gettings synced or programs not finding their database. These are simple
fixed but with so many of them, it was challenging. I didn't know that when we migrated the VMs it would cause so many issues.
