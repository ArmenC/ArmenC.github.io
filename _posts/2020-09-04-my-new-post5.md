<h1>How to create a Kubernetes CLuster</h1>

You may run "minikube version" to see if kubernetes is installed and what version it has.

By running "minikube start" you launch kubernetes and get your cluster going. This might take a second.

Now let's start by deploying an app. The "kubectl create deployment" is a basic command that is used to strt the deployments. 
In the parameters we provide the image and other settings.

Type "kubectl create deployment kubernetes-bootcamp --image=gcr.io/google-samples/kubernetes-bootcamp:v1" to deploy your first application

You should get a confirmation message: kubernetes-bootcamp created. What this did is found a suitable node and scheduled the application to run on that Node.

By typing "get deployments" you cna see all the deployments that are available and running. If you enter it now, you will see your newly created deployment.

Now let's type "kubectl proxy" to open a new terminal with proxy enabled. 

By typing "curl http://localhost:8001/version" we can see all the different information for the pod we will create.

Next think we are going to need to do is get the Pod name so we have that information.

Lets paste "export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -o go-template --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}')
echo Name of the Pod: $POD_NAME"

<h1>Kuberneted Pods</h1>

We created a deployment in the steps above, but where did this get saved? Kubernetes creates pods to host your application instances.
Pods are abstractions that have containers (such as Docker) with shared resources. The containers in the pods share an IP address and also
port space. They also run in a shared context on the same Node. Pods are basically the atomic unit on the Kubernetes platform. 
Whenever you create a Deployment on Kubernetes, it will create pods with containers inside them. The pods are tied to the Nodes they are scheduled
in and they stay there until they are deleted/terminated.

<h1>Kuberneted Nodes</h1>

Every Pod will run on a Node. The nodes could be either virtual or physical machines and they are managed by the Master. Nodes could have 
multiplepods, and the master is the one that automatically handles all the scheduling across all the nodes in the cluster. Every node runs
at least a Kubelet or a container runtime. A kubelet manages the Pods, and is a process that helps the master communicate with the node. The 
container on the other hand pulls the image from a registry, unpacks the container, and runs the application.
