<h1>What are the different interfaces Wireshark captures traffic with?</h1>

Wireshark captures traffic using WinPcap, AirPcap or libpcap link-layer interfaces.

Libpcap - This is the industry standard link-layer interface to capture NIX hosts. 

WinPcap - This is libpcap but the Windows port edition. It consists the windows version of the libpcap API and a driver that gives access to low-level network systems.

AirPcap - This link-layer interface caputures 802.11 traffic on Windows OS. This captures WLAN data in passive mode. It also captures management and control frames.
