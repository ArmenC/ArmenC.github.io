<h1>Creating a Virtual Machine in Hyper-V</h1>

This blog I will be writing instructions on how to set up your first Virtual Machine in Hyper-V.

Open up Hyper-V and click on "New" and select "Virtual Machine"

Write down what name you would like to put for your VM on the first box and select "Next".

Select Generation 2 and click Next. Generation 1 is outdated and is used for different reasons.

This is where you will select the amount of RAM you would like your server to have. You can always change it. Select Dynamic Memory if you like the memory to only be used if needed.

Select the "Connection" to external so that the NIC(ethernet) is picked up from the server.

Leave the first option selected as default. On the labeled box put the storage amount that you want your VM to have. You may start off with 150GB and increase it later

If you have the ISO file of the operating system you would like to install select the second option and find the iso and select it. If not, eave it on the first option and click Next.

After a second of loading, select "Start" to boot up your pc.

After that, you are done. Your new virtual machine has been created and it is ready to be set up just like normal.

Next week I will be writing about Active Directory and its uses.
