This past week I have been working on Lab 2 and it is much more familiar to me ever since I did Lab 1. As I mentioned initally, I was very confused at what Docker does, but now I understand it better. It is pretty much pre configured VM, and that is pretty cool. I even used it at my workplace once. We wanted to create a homepage with all the useful links we use daily with our logo on it, and so I created  the webpage on docker so I could share it with my co-workers. I have also worked on AWS a little and signed up for the course. I am following through and I also ask my coworker for help when I need it. He is AWS certified. I am excited to keep learning and get my certification too. I will continue this blog next week.
