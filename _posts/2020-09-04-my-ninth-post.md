<h2> What is Active Directory?</h2>

Active Directory is a service that comes with Windows Server. It is used to manage computers and devices on a network. A network administrator could use this tool to manage an organization with different groups of employees. It allows security boundaries to be set up, and also it helps keep computers consistent.

<h2> How do you use Active Directory?</h2>

Active Directory is set up using domains, trees, forests, and objects. Objects can range anywhere from users to devices. The users are then organized in Organizational Units. A domain is a collection of objects that include users and devices that belong in a group. For example, you may put all users from a level at a company in one domain. A tree is a group of domains that trust one another and they could authenticate each other. A forest is a group of trees, and a forest is usually used on very big companies.

<h2>What services does Active Directory have?</h2>

- Domain Services: This service stores all the data and manages the communication between the users and the domains. It also has the credentials of the users.
- Certificate Services: This service generates, manages and also shares certificates. It allows users to exchange info throughout the internet securely with a public key.
- LDAP: One of the most important tools of AD. It maintains the directory servces over a network. All the objects are stored here that include the usernames and passwords and can be shared securely throughout the network.
- Directory Federation Services: This service provides a SSN(Single-sign-on) to authenticate user in different web applications in one sesssion. 
- Rights Management: This service protects all the copyrighted information by preventing unathorized use and distribution of content.

<h2>Why should you use Active Directory?</h2>

Active Directory is a very powerful tool for IT Administrators. Imagine having a company with 150 employees and not be able to keep all the computers consistent. Active Directory allows you to put the security measures for each group/computer. Let's say you wanted to have a folder called "Accouting" that nobody could access other than Accountants. This would be very easy in Active Directory. You would just have a group with all the Accountants and you would only allow them to edit/view the file. Active Directory pairs with Group Policy Management and together they become very powerful

Next week I will be writing on how to create Objects in Active Directory.
