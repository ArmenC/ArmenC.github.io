So this week I haven't worked on anything much because I haven't had time to. I started watching some videos on AWS since I have always found it interesting. At work, we use AWS a lot but I have never gotten into it much. I know that most of the time we offer our customers AWS solutions because they don't have to worry about having space for a physical server or power outages stopping their services. Most customers are okay with it but some prefer to have their server inhouse.

Other than that, I have created my amazon account and I will start messing around with AWS and watching more videos. After the VM is selected it pretty much turns into a regular Linux machine which I am more familiar with.
