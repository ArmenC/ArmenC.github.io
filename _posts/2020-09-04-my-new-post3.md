<h1>Wireshark</h1>

This week I wanted to talk about Wireshark. Wireshark is a very important tool that is used by Network Engineers to determine what is causing issues in the network. Say you are experiencing very slow upload speeds and you don’t know why. You might call your provider and they might tell you that everything is fine on their end. You have so many devices, how do you know which device is the problem? By using Wireshark, you can analyze the traffic between the connections and see what is causing the issue.
<br><br>
In order to get started with Wireshark, all you have to do is visit their website and download it. You should be familiar with TCP/IP communications, be comfortable using Wireshark, and also be familiar with how packets flow. Wireshark at its core is a sniffer. It “sniffs” network traffic from one connection to another. Let’s say you start capturing your network traffic right now and then you visit a website. You will see that your system requests and IP for that address. You can see each and every one request that happens, and what protocol it is using. <br>

As you see in the image above, there are lots of connections with DNS protocol and TCP protocols. All of these can be filtered to your liking. Regarding the example mentioned above, you can see that an HTTP request was made to the website that was visited. This is just a very simple analysis that was done, but Wireshark can go much deeper. <br<br>
<h2>How does a typical troubleshooting sessions go?</h2>
Let’s say a customer complained that his connection to the server is spotty.
First you have to set a plan. You discuss what the issue is, and start by choosing where you will capture packets. Will it be from the client to the switch, or from the switch to the server. Maybe you want to not start at the client because the computer might be infected. First rule is to set a plan.
<br><br>
Second you will start capturing. You start a Wireshark capture and put no filters. Watch the traffic of the connections go as you capture for your set amount of time.
<br><br>
Third, you analyze the traffic. Look at the different protocols and see if they are performing correctly. Look at the latency time and make sure there are no spikes. Check if any packets are marked bad by the router or sent back. There are lots of things to check but these are the basics. After analyzing and checking to see the problem, come up with solutions.
<br><br>
Finally, the last step is to repeat. After enforcing the solution, try reproducing the problem again and see if it still happening. If it is solved, you are done. If not, you will need to start again and test different connections.
<br><br>
All network analysis problems should follow this simple protocol and that should help the problem be fixed.  This is only the basis of Wireshark. I will continue learning more about it and write more hands on analysis problems in the further weeks.
