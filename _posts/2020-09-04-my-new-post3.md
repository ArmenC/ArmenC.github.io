<h1> Basics of Google Compute Engine </h1>

Google Compute Engine is Google’s take on Inf--rastructure-as-a-Service where allows you to build multiple VMs quickly and without any need to host on site. The instances that are created can be fully customized or chosen from a list of packaged specifications.

<bold>Virtual Machine Instances<br>

The Virtual machines are chosen with an operation system of your choice and whatever amount of CPU, Memory, Disk, and network protocols you need. <br><br>

The machines are broken down into 4 sections:<br><br>

Standard Machine Type – These are good for easy small systems with respect to RAM and CPU. They usually have about 4 GB of ram per virtual CPU. It is good for creating small programs to test, debug.<br><br>

High-memory machine types – These are good for applications that require more memory. Same as before but more heavy on the ram. You can have 6.5 GB per virtual CPU.<br><br>

Shared-core machine types – These are the most cost effective machines that have one virtual CPU that on a single hyper-thread of a single CPU that is running the instance.<br><br>

Large machine types – These are for very big companies that have very high demanding workloads and these instances can be built to have up to 1TB of memory.<br><br>

Other than all of these types, you can also customize your own. Google charges a small premium for this, but it is worth the cost if you don’t like any of the options above.<br><br>

<bold> Disks <br>

There are two types of disks you may choose to use in your instance. First you have the persistent Disks which are used to keep the data the same way you left it after the instance reboots, and second is the Local disk. The local disks are physical attached to VM instances and are used for very intensive workloads.<br><br>

Persistent Disks – You may choose to have standard persistent disks or SSD persistent disks. The standard ones are ideal for efficient and reliable block storage, and they have a maximum of 64 TB per instance. One downside is that they are only available within a single zone. On the other hand you have SSD persistent disks which have the same benefits but they are faster. What’s great about the persistent disks is that they offer redundancy to make sure your data never fails. The disks are also all automatically encrypted. Resizing the disks also offer 0 downtime.<br><br>

Local Disks – These are ideal for very high-performance block storages. They are available in NVMe or SCSI. They are only available to one instance and they get attached to that one. The maximum amount of storage is 3TB. The cons of this is that it will delete the data after you shut it down, and it does not support snapshots.<br><br>

<bold> Images

Next thing to choose is the image the instance will load. You may create your own image and upload it to google cloud, but there are tons of public images available ready to be used.
These include: CentOS, Container-Optimized OS from Google, CoreOS, Debian, Ubuntu, Windows Server, SQL Server.<br><br>


Next week I will be talking more about GCE and some more features including zones, firewalls, policies, and more.
